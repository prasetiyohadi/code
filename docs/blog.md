First, here are things I’d like to have in the ideal world:

- Modern and minimalist yet functional design
- Markdown support to ensure the content is portable
- Accessible via mobile
- Photo galleries for particular posts and the blog itself
- Email subscriptions
- Affordable enough, so you don’t care about running it forever
- Effortless backups
- Connected to your personal domain
